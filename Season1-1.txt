</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Five airmen are sitting on duty around a table at the bottom of the ramp, playing poker.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
</p><p>Oh man, this hand's as lousy as this detail. All right, everybody, ante up.<br />
(looking to female airman)<br />
That's you too.<br />
(he deals)<br />
</p><p>
Seven to the deuce, nothing there. Boss and the eight, nothing happening. Queen to the king, possible straight going there. Eight on the eight, and the jack gets a boss.  Eights open.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
Aren't you guys afraid of an officer coming down here or something?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 2<br />
Trust me, nobody ever comes down here but us.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
</p><p>(looking to the slightly billowing Stargate cover)<br />
</p><p>
Does that thing always do that?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
Do what?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
Whatever it is under the tarp, I just&#8230;saw it move or do something.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 2<br />
Probably the only thing it ever did was cost money.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
Yeah, and it looks like they ran out of that.  They've been shipping personnel out of here for months.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
</p><p>(seeing tarp move again)<br />
</p><p>
I'm telling you, the thing is moving!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 2<br />
If you don't have the straight, just fold.</p></blockquote>
<p>[She gets up from her seat and makes towards the covered item.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
</p><p>(agitated)<br />
</p><p>
Can we take that as a fold?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 2<br />
Just finish the hand, she's out.</p></blockquote>
<p>[The female airman approaches the tarp and starts up the ramp.  It starts shaking suddenly, they hear a rumbling sound, and she backs away down the ramp as it shakes along with the table where the other airmen are seated. The jump to their feet, hands to their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 3<br />
What the&#8230;?</p></blockquote>
<p>[The tarp flies from the device and reveals the Stargate spinning and active.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 3<br />
Whoa!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
I take it this has never happened before?</p></blockquote>
<p>[Airman 2 goes to the red phone on the wall as the other stand ready at the base of the ramp. The Stargate activates&#8212;the kawhoosh expands outwards and, he drops the phone.  The others fall to the ground as the event horizon billows out towards them. Airman 1 passes out guns, and they ready them, standing and waiting in front of the Stargate. The female airman starts up the ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
What are you doing?</p></blockquote>
<p>[As she reaches the Stargate, a ball drops through it to her feet, glows, and seems to scan her bodily. It falls still, and she bends down to touch it.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 3<br />
What are you doing? </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
Don't touch it!</p></blockquote>
<p>[She picks it up, looking back to them in confusion. Then a serpent guard steps through the wormhole right on top of her, taking a hold of her round the neck and taking her gun. The other airmen aim their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
Hold your fire!</p></blockquote>
<p>[More serpent guards come through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
Identi&#8230;Hold it&#8230;Identify yourself!</p></blockquote>
<p>[The last figure steps through the Stargate, his armour made of gold. He stands in front of his seven guards and reveals his face&#8212;a human face.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>APOPHIS<br />
</p><p>(in echoing voice)<br />
</p><p>
Jaffa! Kree!</p></blockquote>
<p>[The guard holding the female airman reveals his face, and Apophis turns to him.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>APOPHIS<br />
Teal'c, kree!</p></blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c studies the female airman's gun, then drops it and passes the woman roughly to Apophis.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>FEMALE AIRMAN<br />
Get your hands off me!</p></blockquote>
<p>[Apophis brings his hand up and a device emits a glow that latches on to her face, she becomes calm.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 1<br />
Let her go!</p></blockquote>
<p>[One of the serpent guards fires with his staff weapon, and a fire fight ensues. Teal'c covers the female airman with his body as the bullets bounce off the Goa'uld armour. Apophis sees one of his guards go down.  One of the airmen is hit, and he crashes into the card table.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>APOPHIS<br />
Kree! Jaffa!</p></blockquote>
<p>[He waves them back.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN 2<br />
</p><p>(into the phone)<br />
</p><p>
We're under fire down here.  We need&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>[He is hit by a staff blast and goes down. Airmen 1 continues firing until he too is finally struck. The base alarms have started sounding.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>APOPHIS<br />
Teal'c. A'la spree.</p></blockquote>
<p>[He looks towards the Stargate.]

</p><p>[General Hammond and the airmen stream in and take position.  All but Apophis, the female airman and two of his guards are gone.  One picks up the scanning device. The airmen cock their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Hold your fire!</p></blockquote>
<p>[Apophis's eyes glow, his helmet goes up, and they retreat through the Stargate.  It dissipates.]

</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OUTSIDE O'NEILL'S HOUSE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Major Samuels gets out of his car and walks towards the house, he knocks on the door. An airman accompanying him moves round to the side of the house.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>AIRMAN<br />
Sir, there's a ladder over here.</p></blockquote>
<p>[They climb up to where O'Neill has his eye to a telescope pointing to the sky.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
Colonel Jack O'Neill?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
</p><p>(not looking at him)<br />
</p><p>
Retired.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
I'm Major Samuels.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Air Force?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
Yes, sir, I'm the General's Executive Officer.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Want a little piece of advice, Major? Get re-assed to NASA. That's where all the action's gonna be. Out there.</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill continues looking at a galaxy formation through the telescope.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
I'm uh, I'm under orders to bring you to see General Hammond, sir.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Never heard of him.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
He replaced General West. He says it's important. Has to do with the Stargate.</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill finally looks around, interested.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN BASE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[A car enters the base.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ELEVATOR</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill, dressed in casual clothes, is accompanied by an officer down to Sublevel 11. They walk down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>INTERCOM<br />
Tag team number nine to Sublevel Two, Vent Shaft Twenty-Four.</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill signs in at the desk, and they head for a second elevator.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>OFFICER<br />
We have to take a second elevator the rest of the way, sir, it's a long way down.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
</p><p>(entering the elevator)<br />
</p><p>
Yeah I know.  I've been here before.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>OFFICER<br />
Ah, of course.</p></blockquote>
<p>[The elevator descends, and they get out.  Samuels is at the end of the corridor.  He motions O'Neill towards a door.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
 This way, sir.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Samuels follows O'Neill, and the officer takes Samuels's position.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HAMMOND'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[There are two knocks on the door.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Come.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Samuels and O'Neill enter.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
General Hammond, Colonel Jack O'Neill.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Retired.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
I can see that. Me, I'm on my last tour. Time to start getting my thoughts together, maybe write a book. You ever think of writing a book on your exploits in the line of duty?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
</p><p>I've thought about it, but then I'd have to shoot anyone that actually read it.<br />
(getting no response)<br />
</p><p>
That's a joke, sir. Most of my work the last ten years was classified.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Yes, of course.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Major Samuels mentioned something about the Stargate?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
</p><p>Down to business, I can do that.<br />
(standing)<br />
</p><p>
This way.</p></blockquote>
<p>[They all leave the office.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LAB</b>
</p><p>[A doctor pulls back a sheet from dead Jaffa's face.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Anyone you know, Colonel?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DOCTOR<br />
They're not human.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Ya think?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DOCTOR<br />
Best we can tell, these slits are actually a pouch, similar to that found in a marsupial.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
Like a kangaroo.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DOCTOR<br />
We haven't done an autopsy yet.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
These people&#8212;or aliens&#8212;or whatever you want to call them&#8230;came through&#8230;killed four of my people and kidnapped another using advanced weapons.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Weapons, sir?</p></blockquote>
<p>[An airman brings forwards a staff weapon and Hammond hands it to O'Neill.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
We can't figure out how they operate.</p></blockquote>
<p>[With confidence, O'Neill activates and then deactivates the weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Seen one before, I take it?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
</p><p>Yes, sir.<br />
(hands the weapon back)<br />
</p><p>
But there are no creatures like this on Abydos. Those people were human.  They were from Earth. Ra brought 'em there thousands of years ago.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
I know all about that.  But your report said this Ra was in fact some kind of alien that lived inside a human body.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, his eyes glowed.  That was our first clue.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Are you sure he's dead, Colonel?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Unless he could survive a tactical nuclear warhead blowing up in his face, I'm positive. Why?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
These "people", or whatever they are, were guarding another man who retreated back through the Stargate. I got a good look at his eyes, Colonel. They glowed.</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill looks shocked.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Hammond, O'Neill and Samuels are walking.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
How do you feel about the Stargate mission after all this time, Colonel?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
How do you mean?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Well, it's been over a year. Has your perspective changed?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Well, sir I&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill's voice trails off as he notes Ferretti and Kawalsky being led through another door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HAMMOND'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Was that&#8230;?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Kawalsky and Ferretti yes, they were under your command on the first Stargate mission.  Tell me about Daniel Jackson, Colonel.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Through the window in Hammond's office, O'Neill watches Kawalsky and Ferretti in the briefing room.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Why are they questioning my men?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
They're not your men anymore, Colonel&#8212;you retired. Daniel Jackson?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
You read the report?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Yes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
It's all there.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
Is it?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
What's this all about, General?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
You didn't like Daniel Jackson, did you?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Daniel was a scientist. He sneezed a lot. Basically he was a geek, sir.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
So you didn't have a lot of time for him.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
I didn't say that. He also saved my life and found the way home for my men and me&#8212;a little thing like that kinda makes a person grow on ya.  Know what I mean?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
According to the mission brief, your orders were to go through the Stargate, detect any possible threat to earth, and, if found, to detonate a nuclear device and destroy the 'gate on the other side.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
But that's not what you did, is it?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Not right away. Ra's forces overpowered my team and took the weapon before I could arm it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
But with Doctor Jackson's help you eventually regained control and did in fact detonate the weapon. Yes?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
To the best of your knowledge, Daniel Jackson and everyone else you knew on Abydos is dead, correct?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
</p><p>(pausing slightly)<br />
</p><p>
That's correct.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
</p><p>Good.<br />
(standing)<br />
</p><p>
Then you won't mind if I authorize a go ahead on our plan.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[They leave the office.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
This quartz material the Stargates are made of&#8212;it must be tough stuff if it can withstand a Mark III.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Well, we sent a robot probe through after we got back, sir.  It was flattened on the other end. Obviously, the Abydos Stargate had been buried in the rubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>[They enter the gate room.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Well, somehow it got unburied.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[There is a bomb being prepped at the bottom of the Stargate ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Oh my God. You're sending another bomb?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Mark V this time. If these creatures did reopen the Abydos Gate, we intend to reseal it for good.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
General, you can't do that.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Countdown's already started&#8230;Unless you have something to add.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
</p><p>(after a long pause)<br />
</p><p>
General Hammond?  Sir?  I regret to inform you that my report was not entirely accurate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
You didn't detonate the bomb.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
No, I did detonate the bomb, sir, and it was aboard Ra's spacecraft, so it did kill him and eliminate the risk to Earth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
However?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
However&#8230;Ra's ship was in orbit above the planet at the time.  Neither the 'gate nor anything else on the planet was destroyed. Daniel Jackson is alive and living with the people on Abydos.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
You violated direct orders!  Why?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Because the people of Abydos are no threat to us! They deserve to be left alone.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
That's not up to you!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
With all due respect, sir&#8212;if I'd come back here and reported the 'gate on the other side was still intact, we would have sent another bomb, just like you were about to. It wasn't necessary to let those people die. The threat from Ra was gone.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
What about the probe we sent through? It was crushed instantly.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
After we came home, Daniel buried the 'gate in rocks, making my return or anybody else's impossible.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Well, those four bodies lying in the infirmary say otherwise, Airman.</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill sighs.  Hammond studies him for a moment, then turns to the bomb technicians.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
We'll send the bomb through on schedule.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
General, you can't do that!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Oh, I can't?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
There are innocent people on that planet!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
There are innocent people <i>here</i>! I have my orders too, Colonel.  I obey mine. Take Colonel O'Neill to the holding room.  Let's give him some time to think about things while I decide what to do with him.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
I'm retired, Kawalsky.  Lose the salute.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky drops his hand and shakes O'Neill's hand, smiling.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
I appreciate that.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
Hey those kids on Abydos saved my life too.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, the kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>[They sit at a table and chairs.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
They're the whole reason they kept the secret, right?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah.</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill pats Kawalsky reassuringly on the arm.]

Skaara.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
Right. Remember how he was always saluting you?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah, my kid used to do that when he was little. Skaara kinda reminded me of him.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
Oh man, Colonel, you and me went through that whole mission together.  I never even knew you had a son.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Well, he died. Just before the Abydos mission.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
I'm sorry, sir, I had no idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>[The door opens, and they stand as Hammond walks in.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
How many people did you say are on Abydos?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
That we saw?  Maybe five thousand. </p></blockquote>
<p>[Hammond looks down, deep in thought.  Kawalsky and O'Neill exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Does this mean you're reconsidering sending the bomb, sir?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
It means I'm open to suggestions.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
General, let me take a team through that 'gate.  We'll find out who those aliens are.  Kawalsky and I have been there before.  We know the lay of the land.  We know the people.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
You <i>think</i> you do. Daniel could be dead.  You don't know what you'd be walking into.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Sir, there is one way to find out.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Right.  We'll have the prototype probe shipped from MIT.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Well with all due respect, Doctor, I&#8230;</p></blockquote>

Captain Carter's assignment to this unit is not an option, it's an order.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
I'm an Air Force officer just like you are, Colonel, and just because my reproductive organs are on the inside instead of the outside, doesn't mean I can't handle whatever you can handle.</p></blockquote>

Oh, this has nothing to do with you being a woman. I <i>like</i> women. I just have a little problem with scientists.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Colonel, I logged over a hundred hours in enemy airspace during the Gulf War. Is that tough enough for you? Or are we going to have to arm wrestle?</p></blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill raises his eyebrows in amusement.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
I hate to throw a damper on your enthusiasm, but I still say the safest, most logical way to deal with this is to bury the Stargate, just like the ancient Egyptians did, and make it impossible for the aliens to return. It's the only way to eliminate the threat.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Except it won't work.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
It worked before.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
They know what we are now.  They know how far we've come.  We're a threat to them. They've got ships, General.  Ra had one as big as the great pyramids.  They don't need the Stargate to get here.  They can do it the old fashioned way. Now with all due respect to Mister Glass-is-half-empty over here, don't you think maybe we should use the Stargate to do a little reconnaissance before they decide to come back&#8230;again?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
I'll give you exactly twenty-four hours to either return or send a message through.  No Kleenex boxes please. Otherwise, we'll assume the worst and send a bomb through.</p></blockquote>

I think so.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
What does it say?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
Well, uh, it doesn't say anything. Actually it's sort of a chart, more of a&#8230;map.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Of?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
Well I haven't been able to analyze all of it, I mean look at it.  It would take my whole life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Well, Daniel, we don't have that long. What's it a map of?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
Well, the cartouches seem to be separated clearly into groupings.  Each grouping is attached to the others with a series of lines.  And each grouping of glyphs contain seven symbols.  So you can see where this is going, of course.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Tell us anyway.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
All of the symbols are on the Stargate in the Abydos chamber. I've also managed to chart some of them in the Abydos night sky, or at least pretty close. Jack, I think that this is a map of a vast network of Stargates&#8212;Stargates that are&#8230;are all over the galaxy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Uh, I don't think that can be, Doctor.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
Why not?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Well, because after Colonel O'Neill and his team came back, my team tried hundreds of symbol permutations using Earth as the point of origin, and it never worked.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
I tried the same here, and it didn't work either.  But I figured the destinations I tried were either destroyed or buried.  But, um, I mean some of them somewhere must still exist.</p></blockquote>

Then where did your Ra lookalike come from?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Uh&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
Look I don't pretend to know anything about astrophysics but couldn't the planets change? I mean, uh, drift apart or something like that, to throw this map off?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
I knew I'd like you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
You mean I'm right?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
According to the expanding universe model ,all bodies in the universe are constantly moving further apart&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
So in the thousands of years since the Stargate was built&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
All the coordinates could have changed.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
But why does it still work between Abydos and Earth?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Abydos is probably the closest planet in the network to Earth.  I mean the closer they are, the less the difference in relative position due to expansion&#8212;the further away, the greater the difference. In a few thousand more years, it won't work between Earth and Abydos either.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
Unless you can adjust for the displacement.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Right, now with this map as a base, that should be easy. All we have to do is correct for Doppler's Shift.  Then I should be able to arrive at a computer model that can predict the adjustments necessary to get the 'gate working again.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky and O'Neill exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
Okay, so what did we just figure out?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Any civilization advanced enough to build this 'gate network would be able to compensate for 50,000 years of stellar drift.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
So&#8230;the Stargate can go other places?</p></blockquote>

Not as in "God" god. Ra played a god, the sun god.  He borrowed the religion and culture of the ancient Egyptians he brought through the 'gate and then he used it to enslave them. You see, he wanted the people of Abydos to believe he was the only one.</p></blockquote>

Wait a minute. The legend goes Ra's race was dying, he survived by taking over the body of his human host, an Egyptian boy.  But who's to say more of his kind couldn't do the same thing?

Well, they're feeding the revised coordinates into the targeting computer right now. It'll take time to calculate but it should spit out two or three destinations a month.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
People, let's not fool ourselves here.  This thing is both vast and dangerous, and we are so far over our heads we can barely see daylight. We would all be much better off if the Stargate had been left in the ground.</p></blockquote>

With respect, sir, we can't bury our heads in the sand.  I mean think of how much we could learn, think of what we could bring back.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
What you could bring back is precisely what I'm afraid of Captain. However the President of the United States happens to agree with you. In the event your theories pan out, he has ordered the formation of nine teams, whose duties will be to perform reconnaissance, determine threats and if possible to make peaceful contact with the peoples of these worlds. Now these teams will operate on a covert top secret basis.  No one will know of their existence except the President and the Joint Chiefs. Colonel O'Neill?</p></blockquote>

<p>[They depart.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Colonel O'Neill. Care to explain?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CARTER<br />
Um, we can use the Stargate to send these people home, sir.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
</p><p>(motioning to Teal'c)
</p><p>
What's he doing here?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
General Hammond, this is Teal'c. He can help us.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Do you know what he is?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yes, sir I do, he's the man who saved our lives. And if you accept my recommendation, sir&#8230;he'll join SG-1.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
That decision may not be up to you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
Stand back.  Let's get 'em off the ramp.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Kawalsky is on his knees, looking a little distressed.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Kawalsky, are you all right?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>KAWALSKY<br />
Yeah, I'm good.</p></blockquote>
<p>[He stands and regains his composure.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>HAMMOND<br />
Colonel O'Neill, Major Kawalsky, this sure-to-be-very-interesting debriefing for SG units 1 and 2 will be at 0730.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
Yes, sir.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SAMUELS<br />
All right, let's get these people situated.</p></blockquote>
<p>[They leave the Gate Room, leaving Teal'c, Carter, Daniel and O'Neill standing at the base of the ramp. Daniel looks back to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
She's out there somewhere, Jack.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
I know. So's Skaara.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>DANIEL<br />
So what do we do?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>O'NEILL<br />
We find 'em.</p></blockquote>
<p>[He leaves, and the others follow.  Behind them, Kawalsky is still standing at the top of the ramp, almost inside the Stargate. He walks down the ramp towards the camera and as he gets close, his eyes glow.]
